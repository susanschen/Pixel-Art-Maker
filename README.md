## Project Guidelines
This is my completed student project based on this [starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).

| CRITERIA  | SPECIFICATIONS |
|-----------|:---------------------|
|JavaScript Loops and Functions |  Upon the user submitting the grid size, the function makeGrid() successfully displays the grid on the screen dynamically using While and For Loops.|
|JavaScript Selectors and Event Listeners | The code uses selectors to get DOM elements and user input values. The code uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, open up a color-picker, and modify the grid colors. |
